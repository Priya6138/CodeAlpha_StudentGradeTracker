# Student Grade Tracker(Java)

A console/GUI application built in Java to efficiently manage, calculate, and report student academic performance. 
This project was completed as Task 1 of the CodeAlpha Java Programming Internship.

## Project Overview

This system allows users students to input grades for multiple students across various subjects, providing automated analysis and clear reporting.

## Features Implemented (CodeAlpha Task Objectives)

* Student Data Management: Allows input and storage of student records and grades.
* Calculations: Automatically calculates the overall average score for each student.
* Statistical Analysis: Determines and displays the highest Average and lowest scores.
* Summary Report: Generates a structured output displaying student name, calculated average, and final pass/fail status.
* Interface: Built with a [Console-based or Java Swing GUI] for user interaction.

## Technologies Used

* Language: Java Programming
* Development Environment: e.g., VS Code / JDK 
* Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures ([e.g., Arrays / ArrayLists]), Conditional Logic.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
You must have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Steps
1.  Clone the Repository:
    bash
    git clone [# Student Grade Tracker (Java)

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
You must have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Steps
1.  Clone the Repository:
    bash
    git clone []
    
2.  Navigate to the Directory:
    bash
    cd Student-Grade-Tracker
    
3.  Compile the Java Files:
    bash
    javac *.java
    
4.  Run the Main Program:
    bash
    java eg.. GradeTrackerMain
    
5.  Follow the on-screen prompts to input student data.

## Object-Oriented Design

The project uses a modular design based on OOP principles, featuring key classes like:
* Student.java: Models a student with attributes (name, ID, grades).
* GradeTracker.java: Contains the main logic for calculations and report generation.]
